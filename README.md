# Blazor hybrid app that targets native mobile, native desktop and web
This app uses .NET MAUI and Blazor WebAassembly clients with a shared razor component library. 
It demonstates basic architecture, project layout, and how to implement local storage for all platforms. The mobile and desktop apps are native platform apps. 
MAUI handles abstractions for all the native devices. For WebAsm, it uses Blazored, an open source library for local storage.
